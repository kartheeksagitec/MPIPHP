    <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
    <p> <b><i>Overview</i></b>
    <br />
        This Privacy Policy explains Motion Picture Industry Pension & Health Plans' ("MPIPHP's") information-gathering and dissemination practices for our website: www.mpiphp.org (the "Site"). The Site allows you to access the summary plan descriptions of each of MPIPHP's respective Pension, Individual Account, and Health Plans (the "Summary Plan Descriptions") and certain related personal information of yours to the extent and in the manner then currently offered by and through the Site. 
    </p>
    <p>    
        MPIPHP takes your privacy rights seriously and has posted this Privacy Policy to let our users know what information we collect from you, why we collect it and what we do with it. MPIPHP's goal is to collect and use only that information that we think is necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to better understand and serve you, to give you a better experience with the Site, and to allow you to access your personal information related to your benefits. 
    </p>

    <p> <b><i>Acceptance Of These Terms</i></b>
    <br />
        This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the MPIPHP Terms and Conditions for use of the Site. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy or the Terms and Conditions for use of the Site, please do not provide us with any information and do not use the MPIPHP Site or Services. Your continued use of the MPIPHP Site in light of changes to this Privacy Policy will signify your acceptance of the changes for information gathered after the date of the change. 
    </p>

    <p> <b><i>Does This Privacy Policy Apply To You?</i></b>
    <br />
        This privacy policy covers MPIPHP's information collection and use practices for anyone who uses the Site. 
    <br /><br />
        This Site, however, contains links to other websites, advertisers and other third parties. By clicking on any of these links, you are leaving the Site. MPIPHP has no control over the information collected from or about you by any third party after you have left the Site. This Privacy Policy does not cover the data collection and use practices of any third party linked to MPIPHP. MPIPHP assumes no liability and is not responsible for any practices of such third party web sites, including their privacy practices or content. Additionally, a link provided on the Site does not constitute an endorsement of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policies, products, services, or accessibility of that linked web site. Once you link to another web site from the Site, you are subject to the terms and conditions of that web site, including, but not limited to, its Internet privacy policy. 
    </p>

    <p> <b><i>What Information, Including Personally Identifiable Information, Does MPIPHP Collect From And About You?</i></b>
    <br />
        Our goal in collecting information from and about you is to provide you with the best web experience possible, including providing adequate security for your information and to allow you to get the most out of your experience with the Site. 
    <br /><br />
        In order to provide you with our services, MPIPHP collects information from its community through two methods: passive collection of technical information and information you voluntarily provide to MPIPHP, including personally identifiable information. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Passive Collection Of Technical Information. </b>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
                MPIPHP automatically collects your IP address when you visit the Site without you doing anything at all. Your IP address tells us both your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the general geographic location from which you are connecting. Your IP address is used internally by MPIPHP for security reasons, such as to prevent hacking attacks. 
                <br /><br />
                To better serve you, we use "cookies." Cookies are simple text files stored on your web browser to provide a means of distinguishing among users of the Site. The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet web sites. To better serve you, we use "session cookies" for security purposes to identify you. Session cookies can be created automatically on the device you use to access the Site. These session cookies do not contain personal information and do not compromise your privacy or security. We may use the cookie feature to store a randomly generated identifying tag on the device you use to access the Site. A session cookie is erased during operation of your browser or when your browser is closed. 
            </p>

            <b>Information You Provide. </b>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
                MPIPHP does not require anyone to submit any personal information in order to utilize the general portions of the Site. However, if you wish to access your personal information associated with your benefits, you will be required to submit your last name and social security number or Provider Identification Number. This information is required for authentication purposes and to protect the security of your information. MPIPHP does not separately retain this information. 
                <br /><br />
                If during your visit to the Site you send an electronic mail message to MPIPHP, your electronic mail address and the contents of your message will be collected. The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats included in the message. Your electronic mail address and the information included in your message will be used to respond to you, to address issues you identify, or to forward your message to the appropriate department within MPIPHP for appropriate action. Additionally, if you provide MPIPHP with your electronic mail address, or have done so in the past, and have opted-in to receive emails from MPIPHP, MPIPHP or one of its internal departments may upon occasion send you electronic mail to communicate about programs offered by MPIPHP. 
                <br /><br />
                Please note that electronic mail does not provide a completely secure and confidential means of communication and <b><i>may not be</i></b> encrypted. It is possible that your electronic mail communication may be intercepted or viewed by another Internet user while in transit to MPIPHP. Your electronic mail address is not collected for commercial purposes and MPIPHP does not sell or otherwise distribute your electronic mail address for commercial purposes. 
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        <b><i>What Happens To My Information After MPIPHP Collects It?</i></b>
        <br />
        In general, in addition to the purposes listed above, MPIPHP uses information collected from you passively or submitted by you to improve the performance of the Site, such as to determine the number of users logged in simultaneously. MPIPHP also uses the information collected for problem solving purposes, either to solve issues connected with the Site or that individual users may be having with the Site. 
        <br /><br />
        In addition, MPIPHP will not sell, dispose, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent except as specifically set forth in this paragraph. When you choose to supply MPIPHP with your electronic mail address, MPIPHP compiles this information in a database with other MPIPHP community members' information. Further, MPIPHP retains your personal information associated with your benefits. MPIPHP reserves the right to transfer this information to a successor, related entity or to a third party purchasing or succeeding to MPIPHP's assets. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <b><i>How Can You Review And Correct Information You Submitted To The Site Or Opt Out?</i></b>
        <br />
        It is optional to supply MPIPHP with your electronic mail address. However, if you choose to do so, you may change your electronic mail address or delete it from MPIPHP's records by telephoning MPIPHP at 818 or 310-769-0007 ext. 380. We will need to verify your identity during such a call for security purposes. 
        <br /><br />
        Once you have chosen to access your personal information via the Site, you will not be able to opt out of this ability. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <b><i>What Kinds Of Security Procedures Are In Place To Protect The Loss, Misuse Or Alteration Of Information Under MPIPHP's Control?</i></b>
        <br />
        MPIPHP protects your personal information associated with your benefits from access by a third party through the Site by password protection, a security question, and the lock-out of the IP address and social security number attempting to access the information after three invalid tries. If you are locked out through this security mechanism, you can contact MPIPHP via telephone at 818 or 310-769-0007 ext. 106 to reset your social security number log-in. 
        <br /><br />
        To further protect your information, MPIPHP limits access to any personal information submitted by or associated with a user of the Site to only certain of its employees. When you opt-in to receive electronic mail messages from MPIPHP, MPIPHP retains your electronic mail address in a password-protected database that is also protected by a firewall. Additionally, MPIPHP protects information associated with your benefits by keeping it in a password-protected database that is also protected by a firewall. MPIPHP also maintains intrusion detection sensors which are regularly monitored. 
    </p>

        <b><i>Use Of The Site By Children Under The Age Of 18.</i></b>

It is not intended for children and MPIPHP does not want to collect any personally identifiable information from users who are under the age of 18.
